## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

For this challenge you'll need to:

- Create the rounded blue background shape with code
- Change the `fill` and `stroke` color of the SVGs at specific points (the challenge can be completed using the single `logo-bookmark.svg` file provided)
